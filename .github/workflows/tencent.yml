# This workflow will build a docker container, publish and deploy it to Tencent Kubernetes Engine (TKE) when there is a push to the "main" branch.
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Ensure that your repository contains the necessary configuration for your Tencent Kubernetes Engine cluster,
#    including deployment.yml, kustomization.yml, service.yml, etc.
#
# 2. Set up secrets in your workspace:
#    - TENCENT_CLOUD_SECRET_ID with Tencent Cloud secret id
#    - TENCENT_CLOUD_SECRET_KEY with Tencent Cloud secret key
#    - TENCENT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID with Tencent Cloud account id
#    - TKE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD with TKE registry password
#
# 3. Change the values for the TKE_IMAGE_URL, TKE_REGION, TKE_CLUSTER_ID and DEPLOYMENT_NAME environment variables (below).
